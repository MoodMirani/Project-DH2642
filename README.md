# 1. Getting Started with Popify

You need a Spotify Premium account to get started with Popify. The App will ask you for authentification upon start.
If you don't have a Spotify Premium account, you can create it in our app (or ask another TA to grade this project :))

# 2. Download Node.js

You need to download Node.js in order to run Popfify.
You can get Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/

# 3. Npm install

Run `npm install` in your terminal to download all libraries necessary.

# 4. Npm start

To run the app in development mode, run `npm start` in your terminal.
If it's not initialized automatically in your browser, open [http://localhost:3000]
